#### Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code editor used is Juputer notebook on python 3.*

####ðŸ“ŒProject Motivation

For this project, I analyzed the AirBnB data for Seattle(2016) and Boston(2017) to better understand the following:

What are the most common apartment types for both Seattle and Boston ?
What Neighbourhoods have the Highest rates for lisings in both Cities ?
What months of the year had the most bookings for both cities?
Top 10 Neighbourhoods with the highest grossing revenues made from bookings in 2016.
In predicting AirBNB price, what model perfoms better between a model built with non-NaN data and model built with Imputed data.

This project counts towards my udacity data science Nanodegree certification.
The full files for this project are available on kaggle.

#### ðŸ“˜ File Descriptions

There is 1 notebook that contains the code in this project. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. 
Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

#### ðŸ“Š Results 
The main findings insights from the code is made available here
